# twitterbot
Making a twitter bot using python. Account is real, but I'm using selenium and its chromedriver in order to automate a twitter login and certain twitter tasks. Goal is for the account to log in, scroll through tweets, and retweet value info for other users to see without them personally having to scroll through hundreds of tweets manually.
